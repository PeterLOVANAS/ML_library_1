# ML_library_1
My self built Ml library
(This is unfinished project)

The project might include

1. Traditional ML algorithm (e.g. Linear Regression, Support Vector Machine, Random Forest Classification, etc.)
2. Deep Learning Algorithm (e.g. Dense layer, CNN , RNN, LSTM ,etc.)
3. Utility function (e,g, MaxPooling layer , Tokenizer ,etc.) 

*The plan may be changed in the future.

Now the project has 
1. Dense layer (Optimizer : SGD)
2. Convolution layer  (Optimizer : SGD)
3. Loss function
    3.1  binary cross entropy
    3.2  mean square error (MSE)
4. Activation function layer
    4.1  Softmax
    4.2  Tanh
    4.3  ReLU
    4.4  Sigmoid
5. Utility function
    5.1. 2DMaxPooling
    5.2. clip_gradient_by_norm  <= Suggesting by Chat-GPT
